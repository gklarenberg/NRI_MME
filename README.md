This is a manipulative experiment conducted at Nobel Research Institute (OK, USA) crossing carrion biomass levels (single carcasss, mass mortality) with three levels of exclusion (open, herbivore, and scavenger). The hypothesis driving this experiment is that mass mortality events of differing functional groups (herbivores and scavengers) have different effects. We measured soil nutrients, animal activity, soil arthropods, microbes, necrophagous insects, seed bank survival, seed rain, and vegetation recovery. In particular, this project deals with the animal activity, seed rain, seed bank, and vegetation recovery.
